D3D11 GIF Renderer

Project Description

This project implements a custom renderer on Direct3D 11 (DirectX 11) designed for efficient rendering of GIF animations directly from memory. The tool decodes GIF frames and uploads them as textures to the GPU, providing smooth and hardware-accelerated playback without relying on external libraries or file-based resources.

Key Features

1. Render GIF animations entirely from memory buffers;

2. GPU-accelerated playback using Direct3D 11;

3. Support for frame delays and animation looping;

4. Minimal dependencies, lightweight implementation;

5. Designed for integration into real-time applications, overlays, or game engines.

Use Cases

1. Rendering animated assets in custom applications;

2. Building overlays or UI with animated elements;

3. Experimentation with DirectX 11 graphics pipeline;

4. Educational purposes in graphics/rendering research.
